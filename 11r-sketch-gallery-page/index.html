        <div class="description">
            <p>My dancing object is a puppet which wave his arms back-and-forth like a street dance performer. Meanwhile, the legs of the puppet are also slightly moving based on the up-and-down movement of the body. Looking at the four strings which are connected with the elbow and knee joints of the puppet, you can see that they serve as a controlling point of the movements. By moving the mouse on the canvas, the puppet can move within a set range consistent with the y-coordinate of the mouse. Thus, the user will act as a controller of the dancing puppet to alter the "pose" of the puppet.</p>
